# N2176

## Structure of the standard

* Clauses and subclauses: https://www.iec.ch/standardsdev/resources/draftingpublications/directives/principles/organization_subdivision.htm and https://www.iec.ch/standardsdev/resources/draftingpublications/directives/components/
* Paragraphs: The numbered items within each subclause appear (from Stack Overflow etc.) to be known as paragraphs, but I've not found an authoritative source on this.
